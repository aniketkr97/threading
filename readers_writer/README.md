# The Readers-Writers Problem

The **Readers-Writers Problem** is a classic synchronization challenge in concurrent programming. It involves managing access to a shared resource—such as a file, database record, or shared memory—that can be safely read by multiple threads simultaneously, but should only be written to by a single thread at a time with no concurrent readers.

## Key Points

- **Multiple Readers**: Any number of readers can access the resource at the same time since reading does not alter the resource.
- **Single Writer**: Only one writer can be active at a time, and no readers can be active during a write. This ensures data integrity since writing changes the resource.
- **Avoiding Conflicts**:  
  - If a writer is active, all readers must wait.  
  - If a reader is active, a writer must wait until all current readers finish.

## Common Goals

- **Data Integrity**: Preventing any thread from seeing inconsistent data due to concurrent writes.
- **Concurrency**: Allowing as many readers as possible to access the resource simultaneously, provided no writer is active.
- **Fairness**: Ensuring that neither readers nor writers experience indefinite waiting (starvation).

## Variations

1. **First Readers-Writers Problem (Readers Preference)**:  
   Readers never wait if the resource is available. While this allows high concurrency for readers, it risks starving writers if readers keep arriving continuously.
   
2. **Second Readers-Writers Problem (Writers Preference)**:  
   Once a writer arrives, no new readers are allowed until the writer has finished. This prevents writer starvation but may delay readers unnecessarily.
   
3. **Third Variant (Fairness)**:  
   Strives to balance the interests of both readers and writers, often by using queues or ordering mechanisms so that neither side experiences indefinite waiting.
